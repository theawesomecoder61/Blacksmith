# Blacksmith
Blacksmith is a tool for viewing, extracting, and converting textures, 3D models, and sounds from Assassin's Creed: Odyssey, Assassin's Creed: Origins, and Steep.

> **Note 1**: Blacksmith is NOT a repacker.

> **Note 2**: Blacksmith supports ALL VERSIONS (past, latest, and future versions) of each game

> **Note 3**: I *DO NOT CONDONE PIRACY*. The program assumes that you have access to the games' files.

# ➡ Update regarding the repo ⬅
I will no longer be updating the repo with the source code of 1.7 and later. Access to the source code is now a donation perk. I have migrated away from GitHub due to the amount of effort and time I have put into development. Sorry guys.

However, the readme, changelog, and Releases page will still be updated. The repo will stay online and will not be deleted.

### Remember ARchive_neXt?
Blacksmith tries to serve as a successor to ARchive_neXt, since development has seemingly ceased, and it does not support the two latest Assassin's Creed games nor Steep. I designed the functionality of Blacksmith to be identical to that of ARchive_neXt.
